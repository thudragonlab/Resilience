# Evaluating and Improving Regional Network Robustness from an AS TOPO Perspective

Currently, regional networks are subject to various security attacks and threats, which can cause the network to fail. 

We borrowed the quantitative ranking idea from the fields of statistics and proposed a ranking method for evaluating regional resilience.

To improve a regionâ€™s robustness, we proposed a greedy algorithm to optimize the resilience of regions by adding key links among AS. 

We selected the AS topology of 50 countries/regions for research and ranking, evaluating the topology robustness from connectivity, user, and domain influence perspectives, clustering  the  results and get typical region types, and adding  optimal links to improve the network resilience. Experimental results illustrate  that the resilience of regional networks can be greatly improved by establishing a few new connections, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the optimization method.

## Quickstart

1. install python dependencies

```shell
pip install --user -r requirements.txt
```

2. run

```shell
python3 main.py <folder>
```
